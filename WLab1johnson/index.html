    <p> The final battle between Naruto and Sasuke is considered one of the most iconic anime fights. In the battle, Sasuke absorbs Tailed Beast chakra in an attempt to kill Naruto. Naruto tells Sasuke that he won't let Sasuke land any punches like he did last time, and that he won't give Sasuke the title of Hokage. Naruto says that he desires revolution and that the Hokage he speaks of is different from Itachi Uchiha, his brother who protected the village from the shadows</p>
